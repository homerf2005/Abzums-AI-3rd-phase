    "In this project, you will build a classic Tic Tac Toe game that runs in the terminal. Two players take turns choosing positions on a 3Ã—3 grid, trying to get three of their marks (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal. The game should announce a win, tie, or continue until one of those outcomes is reached.\n",

    "This project helps you apply and connect key Python concepts youâ€™ve learned so far:\n",
    "- Working with lists to represent the game board\n",
    "- Using if/else conditions to check for valid moves and winning logic\n",
    "- Repeating the game flow with while loops\n",
    "- Organizing your program into reusable functions\n",
    "- Handling user input and basic error checking\n",
